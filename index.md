## Our latest adventure

<img align="right" style="margin-left:20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ackleyk/freakyfast/master/tom-goldsby.jpg" alt="Tom Goldsby running through the fog and frost">The Freaky Fast team ventured to Asheville, North Carolina on November 1 to participate in the inaugural [Land and Sky Relay](http://gloryhoundevents.com/event/land-and-sky-relay/). The 64 mile, 4-team event ended in Cherokee, North Carolina.

We were split into two teams. Team 1 was Guru, Amy, Hannah, Tom and Joshua and team 2 was Tom, Jim, Kevin and Jason. Diana decided to tag along with team 2 because the thought of being away from Kevin for the entire weekend was too much to bear.

### Race Day!

Only 15 minutes separated the teams' starting times. Team one began at 6:30 and team two hit the road at 6:45. From there, the experience for each team was vastly different. Team two (or Gallant) ran an efficient race. Both the runners and the various drivers of the Armada followed the clearly marked directions for each of the 12 legs and, because of this, showed up to each transition point with plenty of time to spare. Team one (or Goofus) lollygagged at the gas station, showing up late to the transtion at leg 2. From there, they became more incompetent. Ignoring directions from the race director (that was printed on bright yellow paper) as well as Guru, who pleaded with his teammates to not make him drive a road that was clearly only wide enough for a ATV, the 15 passenger van took "the road less travelled". Seven miles and a creek crossing later, the team emerged from the woods and was rewarded with a fifteen minute penalty.
